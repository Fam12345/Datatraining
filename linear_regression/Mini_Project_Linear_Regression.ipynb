    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "[Linear Regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) is a method to model the relationship between a set of independent variables $X$ (also knowns as explanatory variables, features, predictors) and a dependent variable $Y$.  This method assumes the relationship between each predictor $X$ is **linearly** related to the dependent variable $Y$. The most basic linear regression model contains one independent variable $X$, we'll call this the simple model. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is considered as an unobservable random variable that adds noise to the linear relationship. In linear regression, $\\epsilon$ is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0. In other words, what this means is that on average, if we know $Y$, a roughly equal number of predictions $\\hat{Y}$ will be above $Y$ and others will be below $Y$. That is, on average, the error is zero. The residuals, $\\epsilon$ are also assumed to be \"i.i.d.\": independently and identically distributed. Independence means that the residuals are not correlated -- the residual from one prediction has no effect on the residual from another prediction. Correlated errors are common in time series analysis and spatial analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\beta_0$ is the intercept of the linear model and represents the average of $Y$ when all independent variables $X$ are set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\beta_1$ is the slope of the line associated with the regression model and represents the average effect of a one-unit increase in $X$ on $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Back to the simple model. The model in linear regression is the *conditional mean* of $Y$ given the values in $X$ is expressed a linear function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = f(x) = E(Y | X = x)$$ \n",

    "*Image from http://www.learner.org/courses/againstallodds/about/glossary.html. Note this image uses $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ instead of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* The goal is to estimate the coefficients (e.g. $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$). We represent the estimates of the coefficients with a \"hat\" on top of the letter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1 $$\n",

    "[Statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/) is a great Python library for a lot of basic and inferential statistics. It also provides basic regression functions using an R-like syntax, so it's commonly used by statisticians. While we don't cover statsmodels officially in the Data Science Intensive workshop, it's a good library to have in your toolbox. Here's a quick example of what you could do with it. The version of least-squares we will use in statsmodels is called *ordinary least-squares (OLS)*. There are many other versions of least-squares such as [partial least squares (PLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_least_squares_regression) and [weighted least squares (WLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteratively_reweighted_least_squares)."

We can interpret the `RM` coefficient (9.1021) by first noticing that the p-value (under `P>|t|`) is so small, basically zero. This means that the number of rooms, `RM`, is a statisticall significant predictor of `PRICE`. The regression coefficient for `RM` of 9.1021 means that *on average, each additional room is associated with an increase of $\\$9,100$ in house price net of the other variables*. The confidence interval gives us a range of plausible values for this average change, about ($\\$8,279, \\$9,925$), definitely not chump change. \n",

    "\n",
    "The formula gives instruction for a general structure for a regression call. For `statsmodels` (`ols` or `logit`) calls you need to have a Pandas dataframe with column names that you will add to your formula. In the below example you need a pandas data frame that includes the columns named (`Outcome`, `X1`,`X2`, ...), but you don't need to build a new dataframe for every regression. Use the same dataframe with all these things in it. The structure is very simple:\n",

    "\n",

Nonlinearity can sometimes be resolved by [transforming](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/318) one or more independent variables, the dependent variable, or both.

We can check this by plotting each $X$ against $Y$ and verifying that there is no \"funnel\" shape showing data points fanning out as $X$ increases or decreases. Some techniques for dealing with non-constant variance include weighted least squares (WLS), [robust standard errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity-consistent_standard_errors), or variance stabilizing transformations.\n",
